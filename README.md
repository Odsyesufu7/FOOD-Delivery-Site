PROJECT DESCRIPTION
An ordering system is referred to as a set of detail methods that is being used in handling the ordering process. Food ordering can be computerized or done manually. This helps the customer to order their food themselves which is known as the customer self-ordering system. The customer self-ordering system can be defined as a computerized system that is being used by customers to place their own orders in the restaurant and allow the orders to be tracked, in order to prepare and deliver the food to the computers.

Self-service or self-ordering in restaurant industry refers to the restaurant taking orders from customers through applying various types of technologies such as internet and many others. Self-service or self-ordering is successful when it is applied at restaurants in many other countries. The usage of the self-service or self ordering technology is proven to benefit most of the investors.
In addition, the system should be supported by the food origin taste and services to maintain the customersâ€™ loyalty and satisfaction. However, widely implementing the food ordering system may cause the influx of labor due to the elimination of waiters in restaurant industry. Even the system is important to be implemented, yet there is still some risk in other factors such as a direct interaction and restaurant design concept, which need to be considered for ensuring the success of the system.

A fast food restaurant is a restaurant characterized both by food ready to eat quickly after ordering and by minimal service. One trait shared by all fast food establishments is that the customer pays for the food prior to consuming it. Often this food is referred to as fast food. The food in these restaurants is often cooked in bulk and in advance and kept warm or reheated on order.
